## About The Project




CPU Time Express is a comprehensive program designed to be an interactive and user-friendly tool to simulate and analyze different scheduling algorithms. It provides pleasing displays tailored for terminal use. 




## Features



1. Supported Algorithms:
   - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
   - Shortest Job First (SJF)
   - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
   - Round Robin (RR)
   - Non-Preemptive Priority (NPP)
   - Preemptive Priority (PP)
2. Tabulated Display for: 
   - Process 
   - Arrival Time 
   - Burst Time
   - Final Time 
   - Time Quantum for Round Robin
   - Priorities for NPP and PP
   - Turn Around Time 
   - Waiting Time
   - Average Turn Around Time 
   - Average Waiting Time
3. Option to Evaluate all Algorithms for comparison
4. Gantt Charts
